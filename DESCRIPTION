Description: FlexiDeconv is a semi supervised cell type deconvolution
    method that infers cell type proportions across pixels by flexibly
    leveraging the reference, which consists of cell type gene expression
    profiles typically derived from scRNA-seq data. Even though the
    reference is used, FlexiDeconv still actively estimates cell type gene
    expression profiles from the Spatial Transcriptomics data. FlexiDeconv
    allows users to assign weights to the provided cell type gene
    expression profiles, reflecting the extent to which reference
    contributes to estimating gene expression relative to the ST data.
